2. BASIS OF CONTRACT
<br>
 
2.1 The Order constitutes an offer by the Customer to purchase Goods and/or Services from Tech Data in accordance with these Conditions.
<br>
2.2 Any element of an Order shall only be deemed to be accepted at the earliest of despatch of those particular Goods or performance of those particular Services or when acceptance is communicated in writing by an authorised representative of Tech Data at which point, and on which date, the Contract shall come into existence. On receipt of an Order via InTouch Tech Data may send the Customer an order acknowledgement email detailing the Order. This email is not acceptance of the Order by Tech Data and Tech Data may refuse to accept any Order. No elements of an Order placed on InTouch shall become a Contract, or otherwise binding on Tech Data until the despatch of those particular Goods or performance of those particular Services and the Order is marked as confirmed within the "Order Status" facility of InTouch. Where applicable, any automatic renewal of an existing Contract shall be deemed to be renewed for a successive term if parties fail to serve the minimum required notice of termination prior to the renewal date.
<br>
2.3 Any samples, drawings, descriptive matter or advertising issued by Tech Data and any descriptions of the Goods or illustrations or descriptions of the Services contained on Websites or in Tech Data's catalogues or brochures are issued or published for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Services and/or Goods. They shall not form part of the Contract or have any contractual force.
<br>
2.4 These Conditions apply to the Contract to the exclusion of any other terms that the Customer seeks to impose or incorporate in any form, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.
<br>
2.5 Any quotation given by Tech Data shall not constitute an offer and is only valid for a period of 30 days from its date of issue unless otherwise specified by Tech Data. Tech Data reserves the right to increase its quoted or listed prices, or to charge accordingly in respect of any orders for Goods of non-standard specifications prior to acceptance.
<br>
2.6 All of these Conditions shall apply to the supply of both Goods and Services except where application to one or the other is specified.
<br>
2.7 Any Orders for Goods of non-standard specifications cannot be cancelled. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, any request by the Customer for cancellation of any Order or for the rescheduling of any deliveries will only be considered by Tech Data if made at least 12 hours before despatch of the Goods, and shall be subject to acceptance by Tech Data at Tech Data's sole discretion, and subject to a reasonable administration charge. The Customer hereby agrees to indemnify Tech Data and keep Tech Data indemnified and hold it harmless against all Losses suffered or incurred by Tech Data arising out of or in connection with cancellation or rescheduling of the Order.
<br>
2.8 By placing an Order with Tech Data, the Customer warrants that they have obtained and will comply with any consent required from a Manufacturer including, if appropriate, membership of any Authorised Reseller Programme. In the event that the consent or membership of the Authorised Reseller Programme is terminated, the Customer will immediately notify Tech Data in writing and the provisions of Clause 16.4 may be invoked.
<br>


3. GOODS
<br>
 
3.1 The Goods are described in any applicable Goods Specification. Unless otherwise agreed, the Goods are supplied in accordance with the Manufacturer's standard specifications as these may be improved, substituted or modified. Tech Data will use its reasonable endeavours to advise the Customer of any variation for whatsoever reason in the Goods Specification, Manufacturer's specifications or technical data of the Goods as soon as it receives any such notice thereof from the Manufacturer. Tech Data will not be liable in respect of any loss or damage caused by or resulting from such variation including for curtailment or cessation of supply of Goods following any such variation.
<br>
3.2 To the extent that the Goods are to be manufactured in accordance with a Goods Specification supplied by the Customer, the Customer shall indemnify Tech Data and keep Tech Data indemnified and hold it harmless against all Losses suffered or incurred by Tech Data arising out of or in connection with any claim made against Tech Data for actual or alleged infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights arising out of or in connection with Tech Data's use of the Goods Specification. This Clause 3.2 shall survive termination of the Contract.
<br>

4. DELIVERY OF GOODS
 <br>
4.1 Tech Data shall deliver the Goods to the location set out in the Order or such other location as the parties may agree in writing (the "Delivery Location").
<br>

The Customer must sign the POD accordingly. If the exterior of the Goods are damaged the Customer must indicate this on the POD. The Customer must inform Tech Data of any difference to quantity or of damage as soon as possible and in any event within 5 Business Days of the delivery.
<br>
4.4 A signed POD by or on behalf of the Customer, or signing the POD "unchecked" or "unexamined" or any such similar wording, shall be conclusive evidence of delivery and (except to the extent that any damage or discrepancy is noted on the POD) that it was received in good order and condition and accordingly no claims shall be bought in respect of the delivery claiming the contrary.
<br>
4.5 The Customer must inspect the Goods immediately after delivery is complete. If any Goods are damaged, incorrect or not delivered, the Customer must notify Tech Data within 5 Business Days of the delivery or expected delivery.

<br>
4.8 Any dates quoted for delivery of the Goods are approximate only, and the time of delivery is not of the essence. Despatch may be postponed because of conditions beyond Tech Data's reasonable control, such as a Force Majeure Event, a delay caused by the carrier or the Customer's failure to provide Tech Data with adequate delivery address detail or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Goods, and in no event shall Tech Data be liable for any damages or penalty for delay in despatch or delivery of the Goods or consider any claims for compensation.
<br>

<br>
(a) delivery of such Goods shall be deemed to have been completed at 9.00 am on the Business Day following the day on which Tech Data attempted delivery of the Goods; and
<br>
(b) Tech Data shall store the Goods until delivery takes place and charge the Customer for all related costs and expenses (including insurance).
<br>
4.10 If 10 Business Days after Tech Data notified the Customer that the Goods which are non-standard specification were ready for delivery the Customer has not taken delivery of them, Tech Data may resell or otherwise dispose of part or all of the Goods and, after deducting reasonable storage and selling costs, account to the Customer for any excess over the price of the Goods or charge the Customer for any shortfall below the price of such Goods.
<br>
4.11 Tech Data may deliver the Goods by instalments, which shall be invoiced and paid for separately. Any delay in delivery or defect in an instalment shall not entitle the Customer to cancel any other instalment.
<br>
4.12 Where Goods are being delivered outside the UK to a destination which requires a UK export declaration and/or a destination import declaration, other than risk which shall pass in accordance with Clause 6.1, the Goods will be supplied CIP port/airport country of destination Incoterms 2010.

<br>
5.4 Subject to Clause 5.5, Tech Data shall, at its option, repair or replace the defective Goods, or refund the price of the defective Goods in full if the Customer returns the Goods in accordance with Clause 9.1.

<br>

<br>
(a)the Customer makes any further use of such Goods after giving a notice in accordance with Clause 4.5;

<br>

The marketed and official real-time price of the Goods or Services on InTouch shall be confirmed using the InTouch "On-line Check" facility. All other listed prices on Websites are shown on the understanding that they are a guideline only. The price for Goods:
<br>

(b) shall be exclusive of all costs and charges of packaging, insurance, transport of the Goods, which shall be invoiced to the Customer.<br>

10.2 The charges for Services shall be calculated in accordance with fee rates set out in the Order or Service Specification.
<br>
10.3 Whilst Tech Data tries to ensure that all prices are accurate, errors may occur. If, prior to delivery of the Goods or performance of the Services, Tech Data discovers an error in the price of the Goods or Services or there is an increase in the cost to Tech Data of the Goods or Services due to reasons outside Tech Data's control, Tech Data reserves the right to correct or increase the price of the Goods or Services, by giving notice to the Customer at any time before delivery, to reflect any increase in the cost of the Goods or Services to Tech Data.

<br>
10.4 All amounts payable by the Customer under the Contract are stated in Pounds Sterling, US Dollars or Euros (as stated in the invoice) and are exclusive of amounts in respect of value added tax chargeable from time to time (VAT). Where any VAT is due to be collected by Tech Data for a taxable supply for VAT purposes made under the Contract by Tech Data to the Customer, the Customer shall, on receipt of a valid VAT invoice from Tech Data, pay to Tech Data such additional amounts in respect of VAT as are chargeable on the supply of the Services or Goods at the same time as payment is due for the supply of the Services or Goods.
<br>
10.5 In respect of Goods, Tech Data shall invoice the Customer on or at any time after completion of despatch.

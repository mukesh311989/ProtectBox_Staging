			<h4>1. ProtectBox is a Marketplace
			</h4>
			ProtectBox acts as a marketplace to allow Suppliers who comply with ProtectBox's policies to offer and sell certain goods within an optimised-price format. ProtectBox also acts as a marketplace to allow Buyers who comply with ProtectBox's policies to search for and buy certain goods within an optimised-price format. ProtectBox is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, ProtectBox has no control over the quality, safety, morality, or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. ProtectBox cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.
			<br>
			Consequently, ProtectBox does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.

			<h4>3. Fees and Billing
			</h4>
			Joining ProtectBox is free. ProtectBox does not charge fees for buying items on sale or listing an item for sale. Depending on your agreement with ProtectBox, ProtectBox will either take a percentage or a set amount of the sale price when the item sells. ProtectBox may, at ProtectBox's sole discretion, change some or all of ProtectBox's services at any time. In the event ProtectBox introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, or indicated through the functionality on the site, all fees are quoted in Pound Sterling (GBP).
			<br>
			In certain situations, including but not limited to a void or invalid transaction, ProtectBox may issue a credit for the applicable fees to a seller or Supplier.
			<br>
			Suppliers are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using and selling on ProtectBox.
			<br>
			Price: Price is the set product rate by Supplier, including taxes, tariffs, and any other applied costs. Suppliers are required to list prices (including associated costs in the total price shown on ‘Price Detail’, with a breakdown of the component associated costs shown in the ‘Product Link’ information. ProtectBox will not cover associated costs listed within ‘Product Link’ on 
			<a href="https://www.ProtectBox.com/edit-solution.php" target="_blank">https://www.ProtectBox.com/edit-solution.php
			</a>)  for the products Suppliers sell through the ProtectBox Marketplace. ProtectBox will pay Suppliers based on the prices that they list for their products, either paying out a percentage of the price or a set amount based on the price (as indicated in ‘Commission Detail’ or agreed separately in writing). ProtectBox reserves the right to adjust the prices displayed to users or Buyers within the movement range agreed by Suppliers to optimise sales for our Suppliers. This does not affect the amount or percentage ProtectBox has agreed to pay to Supplier for their orders. If Suppliers have not agreed with the movement range, ProtectBox will never change their prices. In this case, Suppliers will pay the payment processing fees (as detailed in https://stripe.com/gb/pricing), all refund costs, and ProtectBox will not promote their products (no notification, no ads, no discount incentives etc).
			<br>
			ProtectBox will pay Suppliers for their transactions at point of sale unless agreed (in writing) otherwise and in advance. This payment will be a net amount: the Supplier's prices (product) less our charge, per the revenue share or cost.
			<br>
			<h4>4. Listing and Selling
			</h4>
			Listing Description: By listing an item on the Site, you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with ProtectBox's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your ProtectBox shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other contents relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags as per the instructions given on the site. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the quantity available is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical.
			<br>
			Binding Sale: All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: the transaction cannot be completed, due to laws, regulations, policies, natural disasters, wars, strikes and other unforeseen factors. Or previously agreed otherwise, in writing. The cost arising from not completing orders in time shall be undertaken by the Supplier.
			<br>
			Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not charge excessive prices or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding ProtectBox transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another Supplier's account without permission.

			Suppliers that sell regularly on the ProtectBox platform may be required to reserve for VAT. Although ProtectBox does not require sellers to have a VAT number to sell in our marketplace, Suppliers may be required to pay for VAT for conducting such business in the applicable tax jurisdictions.
